## :fontawesome-regular-newspaper: Platform Overview

Built for DevOps, Platform Engineers, and SREs, this solution streamlines cluster management by eliminating operational overhead, automating deployments at scale, and enforcing consistency across environments—whether using a distributed or hub-and-spoke architecture.

Reduce complexity, embrace automation, and accelerate delivery with a scalable, self-healing, and declarative approach to Kubernetes management.

## :fontawesome-regular-pen-to-square: Why This Pattern?

Managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across different environments presents challenges in consistency, scalability, and automation. This solution provides:

- Standardized provisioning – Automate cluster creation with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- GitOps-based management – Declarative, version-controlled deployments using ArgoCD.
- Flexible architectures – Support for both distributed and hub-and-spoke models.
- Secure multi-cluster operations – Enforce policies, RBAC, and secrets management at scale.
- Tenants Applications - Provides tenants consumers an easy way to onboard their workloads.

## :fontawesome-regular-handshake: Platform Tenets

Too often, platforms are designed from a purely technical standpoint, packed with cutting-edge tools and complex abstractions—yet they fail to deliver a great developer experience. They become rigid, overwhelming, and unintuitive, forcing teams to navigate layers of complexity just to deploy and operate their workloads.

This is where strong platform tenets come in.

- Treat the platform as a product, not just infrastructure—it should have clear users, a roadmap, and continuous improvements.
- Focus on developer experience make workflows intuitive and efficient.
- Provide self-service capabilities for developers to deploy and manage workloads independently.
- Ensure guardrails, not gates—provide secure defaults but allow flexibility when needed.
- Optimize for usability and maintainability, not just technical capability.
- Reduce cognitive load by abstracting unnecessary infrastructure details.
- Follow opinionated defaults but allow extensibility for advanced use cases.
